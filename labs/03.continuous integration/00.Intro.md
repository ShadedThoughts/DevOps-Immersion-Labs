## Development Team

As HealthClinic organization grows, they will want to make sure that they configure the Agile tools to support that growth. To enable each feature team the autonomy it needs to manage their backlog and plan their sprints, they need their own set of team tools.
HealthClinic has three different agile teams working in the same project, with the same goals, but they need a tooling that allows them to work in an agile environment with autonomy.
