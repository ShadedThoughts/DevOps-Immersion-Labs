# CONCLUSION

When many developers collaborate on complex software projects, it can be a long and unpredictable process to integrate different parts of code together. However, you can make this process more efficient and more reliable if you build and deploy your project continuously.

**Continuous integration** (CI) is the process of integrating your code into a shared repository as frequently as possible. During code integration, a build break or a test failure can inform you, in a timely manner, of an error in your code.

Martin Fowler has the following breakdown of practices for continuous integration:

- Maintain a single source repository.
- Automate the build.
- Make your build self-sustaining.
- Check in at least once a day.
- Build each check-in on the CI server.
- Keep the build fast.
- Test in a clone of the production environment.
- Make it easy for anyone to get the most recent executable.
- Always be aware of what is happening.
- Automate deployment.

Visual Studio Team Services help you manage the end-to-end process of software development and supports the practice of continuous integration. By leveraging the capabilities of Visual Studio, your project can avoid unexpected delays, cost overruns, and execution risks.
