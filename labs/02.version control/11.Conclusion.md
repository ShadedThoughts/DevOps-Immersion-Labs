# CONCLUSION

Use version control to save your work and coordinate code changes across your team. Even if you're just a single developer, version control helps you stay organized as you fix bugs and develop new features.
Version control keeps a history of your development so that you can review and even rollback to any version of your code with ease.

Visual Studio Team Services supports two types of version control Git and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC).

Git is the default version control provider for new projects. You should use Git for version control in your projects unless you have a specific need for centralized version control features in TFVC.

You can use TFVC repos with Git in the same Team Project so it's easy to add TFVC later if you need centralized version control.
