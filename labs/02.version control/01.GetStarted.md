# VERSION CONTROL

Use version control to save your work and coordinate code changes across your team. Even if you're just a single developer, version control helps you stay organized as you fix bugs and develop new features.
Version control keeps a history of your development so that you can review and even rollback to any version of your code with ease.

Visual Studio Team Services supports two types of version control Git and Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC).

Git is the default version control provider for new projects. You should use Git for version control in your projects unless you have a specific need for centralized version control features in TFVC.

You can use TFVC repos with Git in the same Team Project so it's easy to add TFVC later if you need centralized version control. 

## Git (distributed)

Git is a distributed version control system. Each developer has a copy of the source repository on their dev machine. Developers can commit each set of changes on their dev machine and perform version control operations such as history and compare without a network connection. Branches are lightweight. When you need to switch contexts, you can create a private local branch. You can quickly switch from one branch to another to pivot among different variations of your codebase. Later, you can merge, publish, or dispose of the branch.

## TFVC (centralized)

Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC) is a centralized version control system. 
Typically, team members have only one version of each file on their dev machines. Historical data is maintained only on the server. Branches are path-based and created on the server.

## Version control workflow

Version control has a general set of tasks that most developers will repeat when writing code and adding it to the project. 

These steps are:

- Update their local copy of code.
- Make changes to code.
- Once the code is ready, review the changes with the team.
- Save the code to a server so others where the rest of the team can pick up the changes.
