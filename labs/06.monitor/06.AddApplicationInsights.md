    > As we saw in this lab configuring Application Insights, we have now the key already added from the beginning. The Nuget package, Startup.cs file and _layout.cshtml files has been modified to include Application Insights.

1. Open **Startup.cs** file, as you also see the lines for Application Insights configuration has already been added automatically.
