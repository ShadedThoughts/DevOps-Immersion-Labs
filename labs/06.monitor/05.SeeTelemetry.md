    > This opens the azure *blade* with all the information about the server response time of all the calls which have ocurred to the application, and its times. So we can detect for example bottlenecks in our application in particular pages.

    > We have a lot of other metrics avaliable, like **Page view load time** which measures times from client side informing how long the pages take to load in the client side.
