# CONCLUSION

Telemetry with Application Insights on our applications allow us to learn about usage patterns from our customers but also detect errors, and be proactive about future needs of our infrastructure.

## Add Telemetry

Telemetry can be easly added for new or existing applications from Visual Studio, with just one simple click. Visual Studio 2015 provides us the tools and packages to easily add telemetry to any Web Application, not only .NET Core, but also ASP.NET applications.

All telemetry is sent to Windows Azure, so we can review and take the appropiate actions as needed.

## Consume telemetry

We can read the telemetry directly with the tools from the Azure Portal, and also manage alerts about our applications.  

This provides us a single point of telemetry for our applications, being able also to export, store and analyze information about the behaviour of our production applications.
