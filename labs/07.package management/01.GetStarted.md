# PACKAGE MANAGEMENT

Package Management is an extension that makes it easy to discover, install, and publish packages. 

It's deeply integrated with other Team Services hubs like Build so that package management can become a seamless part of your existing workflows.

Your product is successful, your organization is growing, and it’s time to scale up your codebase to match. As you scale out past 2-3 teams working in a single codebase on a single product, you may find yourself asking questions like:

- How do my teams effectively share reusable components?
- How do I enable my feature teams to iterate rapidly without stepping on other teams’ work?
- How do I give my teams autonomy to iterate at the pace that’s right for them?

These questions aren’t just applicable to newly growing teams. If you’re an established team with a legacy codebase, you may be asking these same questions as you’re being asked to deliver more value, ever faster. Regardless of your situation, componentization can help you build a codebase that scales to the size of your team and the speed of today’s development.

In this module, we'll explore how binary composition through package management can help you manage and share your external dependencies, your OSS, and your isolated shared components.
