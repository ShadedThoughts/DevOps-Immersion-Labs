# CONSUME PACKAGES FROM TEAMBUILD

> When we create builds, the first step is the **Nuget package restore** step, but by default, it will only look for packages in *nuget.org* feed. So we need to give instructions to **Team Build** it is done via **nuget.config** files.  

1. Create an empty file named **nuget.config** at the same level as the solution file you will be building with **Team Build** and paste this code:  
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<configuration>
  <packageSources>
    <add key="NuGet" value="https://api.nuget.org/v3/index.json" />
    <add key="HealthClinic Repo" value="https://devopsmhc.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_packaging/HealthClinicPackages/nuget/v3/index.json" />
  </packageSources>  
</configuration>
```  
> The first package source is needed to indicate the original Nuget feed for the Nuget public Nuget packages. The second one is the url for our custom feed.  

1. Commit the file to the repository.

1. Now, in the Team Build you are using for building the project which uses the internal Nuget package, on the package restore step, point to the **nuget.config** file we just added to the repository.

1. During the build you can see the console ouput while building the project which references the internal Nuget feed.
