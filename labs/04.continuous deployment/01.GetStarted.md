# AUTOMATION APPLICATION RELEASE

## What is Release Management?

Release Management is a service in Visual Studio Team Services that helps you automate the deployment and testing of your software in multiple environments. Using Release Management, you can either fully automate the delivery of your software all the way to production, or set up semi-automated processes with approvals and on-demand deployments. It is an essential element of DevOps that helps your team continuously deliver software to your customers at a faster pace and with lower risk.

Release Management can be used by all kinds of software developers for continuous automated deployment, or by large enterprises to improve efficiency and collaboration between various teams that participate in release processes.

To use Release Management, you create release definitions, in which you specify the automation tasks that should be run in each environment. These automation tasks can be to deploy your software and to run tests against it. You can group multiple environments in each definition to model your software lifecycle. You can then set up the deployment in each environment to be automatically triggered upon completion of a build, at scheduled times, or on successful deployment to a previous environment.

## Is Release Management for you?

You should consider using Release Management if:

- **You develop applications and need to deploy them regularly to any platform**, public or private cloud services, or App stores. Release Management has many out-of-the-box tasks to deploy a variety of applications. If you cannot find an out-of-the-box task to deploy your application using Release Management, consider this: if you can script the deployment of your application using Shell scripts or PowerShell scripts, utilities such as Ant or Maven, batch files or EXE utilities, then you can deploy it using Release Management. Release Management also integrates with third party deployment systems such as Chef and Docker.

- **You use a Continuous Integration (CI)** system and are looking for a fully-fledged continuous delivery or release management system. Whether you use Team Build from Team Services or Team Foundation Server, or Jenkins as your CI system, you can set up Release Management to automatically deploy new builds to multiple environments. Even if we do not yet support integration with your favorite CI system or artifact repository, you can still write custom tasks to download and deploy artifacts from it.

- **You need to track the progress of releases**. If you use several environments for your tests, Release Management helps you monitor whether a release has been deployed and tested on each of these environments. Release Management also tracks whether an issue fixed by a developer, or a product backlog item completed by your team, has been deployed to a specific environment.

- **You need control of the deployments**. Release Management lets you specify which users can change the configuration of an environment, or approve the release to be deployed into a particular environment. If there is a problem with your deployment, Release Management helps you roll back to a previous deployment, and provide all the logs in one place to help you debug the problem.

- **You need audit history for all releases and their deployments**. Release Management provides a history of all changes to the definitions, configurations, and deployments. It also provides a history of all the activity performed during each deployment. Each release is accompanied by a listing of new features and developer commits that went into that release.

## Release Management workflow

When using Release Management, here are the steps that you typically follow:

- **Create release definitions:** You start using Release Management by creating a release definition in the Release hub of your team project. A release definition specifies (a) What to deploy - the set of artifacts that constitutes a new release, and (b) How to deploy - the series of automation tasks that should be run in each environment.

- **Add environments:** You add one or more environments to a release definition. Each environment is simply a named logical entity that represents a deployment target for your release. For example, you create environments for test, quality assurance, staging, and production. You then edit the environments to specify the lists of users that must approve the deployment where this is appropriate.

- **Add tasks:** You add automation tasks to each environment. These tasks describe the deployment and testing process. There is a wide range of pre-defined tasks you can use. These tasks can take advantage of shared custom variables and built-in properties in their configuration. Your tasks may need to connect to other services, cloud platforms, or third party deployment and testing services. For this, you define your global service endpoints.

- **Create and deploy releases:** Once you have created a release definition, you can manually create a new release based on this definition and deploy it to various environments, or you can let a release be created automatically and deployed upon completion of a build. There is a wide range of options for creating a release and deploying it, including release date and time, pipeline or parallel deployment, and more. You can also monitor the new changes that went into each release.

- **Track deployments:** As a release is deployed to various environments, you track its progress. You can approve new deployments to an environment, and view the logs of deployments as they happen.

    > **NOTE:** It's important to recognize the difference between a release and a deployment. A release is simply a package or container that defines the set of versioned artifacts and other information for a specific set of deployments. It's basically a snapshot of the release definition at the point the release is created, allowing the release definition to be modified independently from the release. A release definition can be used to create multiple releases. Each release generates a deployment to one or more environments by executing tasks. Deployments can be initiated manually or orchestrated automatically, as part of a pipeline of parallel or sequential deployments.
