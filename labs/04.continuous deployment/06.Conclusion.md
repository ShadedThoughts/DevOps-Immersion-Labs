# CONCLUSION

Release Management is a service in Visual Studio Team Services that helps you automate the deployment and testing of your software in multiple environments. Using Release Management, you can either fully automate the delivery of your software all the way to production, or set up semi-automated processes with approvals and on-demand deployments. It is an essential element of DevOps that helps your team continuously deliver software to your customers at a faster pace and with lower risk.

Release Management can be used by all kinds of software developers for continuous automated deployment, or by large enterprises to improve efficiency and collaboration between various teams that participate in release processes.

To use Release Management, you create release definitions, in which you specify the automation tasks that should be run in each environment. These automation tasks can be to deploy your software and to run tests against it. You can group multiple environments in each definition to model your software lifecycle. You can then set up the deployment in each environment to be automatically triggered upon completion of a build, at scheduled times, or on successful deployment to a previous environment.
