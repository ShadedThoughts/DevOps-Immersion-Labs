    > When creating the projects, the template you are going to choose it is important, as it will define how Work Items will work for planning your work.

    > You have three options:
    > -	**Scrum**: it is oriented to teams which are practicing Scrum and are fully comfortable with the Scrum terminology.
    > -	**Agile**: it can fit any agile process, even Scrum, but it uses more genereic terminology to fit other Agile processes.
    > -	**CMMI**: it fits with process described in the CMMI methodology, as well as its terminology. This is perfect if you are going through CMMI certification.
