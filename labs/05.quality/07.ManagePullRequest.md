    > You can choose to squash merge your pull request and delete the source branch once the merge is complete.

    > **Squash merging** is a merge option that allows you to condense the Git history of topic branches when you complete a pull request. Instead of each commit on the topic branch being added to the history of the default branch, a squash merge takes all the file changes and adds them to a single new commit on the default branch. Squash merging keeps your default branch histories clean and easy to follow without demanding any workflow changes on your team. 

1. Click Complete merge.
